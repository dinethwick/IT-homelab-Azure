# IT-homelab-Azure
This was a homelab I created to practise Helpdesk and SysAdmin tasks - like Active Directory, Server Management, Configuring Domains, RDP, Shares, and User Account Management.  It was done on Azure, with a Server 2019 VM and a Windows 10 Pro VM.

I documented the entire process and published it onto a website - you can visit it [*here*](https://brave-rifle-b85.notion.site/HOMELAB-Azure-2418cb63537e81c3b8cfef17afb3447e)
